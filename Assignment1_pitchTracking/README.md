# ACA_assignment1
Assignment1- Pitch Tracker

## Note
Code now works properly

### Confirmation
1. Function findpeaks() is ok to use in the assignment.
2. yinym's sharelatex email is yinym@shanghaitech.edu.cn

#### TODO (Ask Alex professor)
~~Ask if we can use findpeaks() (built-in function) used in myGetF0FromAcf.m~~
1. Change simple ACF to circular ACF (likely)
2. Report ShareLatex link: https://www.overleaf.com/read/bksmfsdgfkwr
